Welcome to CodeNest ! 
This repository is a collection of my important codes. Feel free to explore, use, and contribute.





## Introduction
CodeNest is designed to be a central hub for all my essential codes. It includes a variety of scripts written in Python programmming language majorly. Whether you're a developer looking for inspiration or a beginner wanting to learn, this repository has something for everyone.

## Features
- A diverse collection of code snippets
- Well-documented and easy-to-understand code
- Regular updates and additions

## Code Details

- Code 1 : **DownloadingPretrainedModels.ipynb** is a script used to download Pretrained Models from the internet into your local machine.
- Code 2 : **ParquetsCompressionTesting.ipynb** is a script used to generate a DataFrame showing the write time, read time (in seconds), and file size (in MB) for each compression type. Replace the sample dataframe in script with yours and analyze the results to understand which compression type offers the best trade-off between file size and performance based on your specific requirements.
